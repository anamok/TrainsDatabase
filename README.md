### Project Description 
From guide_extended.pdf: in this project, groups were given an analysis of the requirements of the supposed travel agency Costa Express, which specializes in organizing train journeys. Groups were asked to conceptually model the described mini-world(project.pdf) and then implement it using the relational database PostgreSQL. Implementation of the application was completed in Java using JDBC.
